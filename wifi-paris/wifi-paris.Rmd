# Project

The city of Paris has released a dataset containing a list of all connections made in 2016 on the ~300 public wifi hotspots, available on their [open data website](https://opendata.paris.fr/explore/dataset/utilisations_mensuelles_des_hotspots_paris_wi-fi/information/). The dataset is 1.7M rows long, and features a number of interesting information for each session such as time, volume downloaded/uploaded, device, browser, OS and language. I have explored this dataset to infer who is using public wifi and find insights about behaviours and equipment.

# Results

Some of the key insights of the analysis include:   
* The most used hotspot is at the Notre-Dame cathedral   
* 67% of all connections are made through Mobile/Tablet  
* Apple devices represents 38% of connections   
* French is less than half of the devices language, and does not lead in the most touristic areas.

# Code

## Preparing data

### Setup and libraries

```{r, echo=FALSE}
Sys.setenv(TZ='Europe/Paris')
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE)
```

```{r, results='hide'}
library("tidyverse")
library("stringr")
library("corrplot")
library("ggmap")
library("lubridate")
library("knitr")
```

### Load and format main file
```{r, cache=TRUE, message=TRUE}
wifi.raw <- read_delim("./wifi-data-2016.csv", progress = FALSE,
                       delim = ";", na = c("NULL", ""), col_types = "ccnnnccccc")
```

```{r, cache=TRUE}
wifi.2 <- 
    wifi.raw %>%
    mutate(start_time = as_datetime(str_replace(start_time, "T", " ")),
           stop_time = as_datetime(str_replace(stop_time, "T", " "))) %>%
    mutate(input_mo = round(input_octets/1024^2, 2),
           output_mo = round(output_octets/1024^2, 2),
           language = str_match(langue, "([a-z]{2})?_?([A-Z]{2})?")[,2],
           country = str_match(langue, "([a-z]{2})?_?([A-Z]{2})?")[,3]) %>%
    select(-c(input_octets, output_octets)) %>%
    arrange(start_time)
```

```{r}
wifi <- wifi.2
glimpse(wifi)
```



### Adding new features

We will compute new features based on the current information we have, in order
to improve our analysis.  

First, let's simplify all OS into fewer, clean categories

```{r}
# Get OS Type
wifi <- 
    wifi %>%
    mutate(os_type =
           if_else(str_detect(os, "(Debian|Fedora|Mageia|MeeGo|Ubuntu|BSD)"),
                   "Linux",
                   if_else(str_detect(os, "(Windows|Mac OS|Linux|Chrome OS|Kindle|Black[Bb]erry|iOS|Android)"),
                           str_extract(os, "(Windows|Mac OS|Linux|Chrome OS|Kindle|Black[Bb]erry|iOS|Android)"),
                           "Other")
                   )
           )

```

Then, let's extract the device brand, based on the OS (for Apple), or the full device name.

```{r}
# Get Device Brand
wifi <- 
    wifi %>%
    mutate(device_brand =
           if_else(os %in% c("iOS", "Mac OS X"), "Apple", 
                   case_when(str_detect(device, "^L-EMENT") ~ "Logicom",
                             str_detect(device, "Kindle") ~ "Amazon",
                             TRUE ~ str_to_title(str_sub(str_extract(device, "^[:alpha:]{2,}[ -]"), end = -2))
                             )
                   )
           )
```

Finally, let's guess if the device is a Computer or a Mobile/Tablet

```{r}
# Get Type of Device
wifi <-
    wifi %>%
    mutate(device_type =
           if_else(str_detect(browser, "Mobile"),
                   "Mobile/Tablet",
                   if_else(str_detect(os, "(Mobile|Phone|Bada|Symbian)"),
                           "Mobile/Tablet",
                           if_else(str_detect(os_type, "(Android|Blackberry|iOS)"),
                                   "Mobile/Tablet",
                           if_else(str_detect(os_type, "(Windows|Linux|Mac OS)"),
                                   "Computer", ""), 
                           ""),
                           ""),
                   "")
           )
wifi$device_type[wifi$device_type == ""] <- NA
```

### Join with map of hotspots

As the location of the hotspots is in a different source, we need to join it with our main dataframe. But we first have to do some cleaning on the names of the sites, that are sometimes misspelled.

```{r}
# Load map of hotspots
wifi.map <- read_csv2("./wifi-hotspots-list.csv")
names(wifi.map) <- c("Id", "Nom", "Address", "CP", "City", "GeoPoint")

# Join, using semi-manually cleaned correspondance file
wifi.map <-
    read_csv("./wifi-hotspots-list-clean.csv") %>%
    left_join(wifi.map, by = c("Id" = "Id")) %>%
    select(site_key = Site.1, site_clean = Site.Clean, site_id = Id, site_xy = GeoPoint) %>%
    filter(!is.na(site_xy)) %>%
    separate(site_xy, into = c("site_geo_y", "site_geo_x"), 
             sep = ", ", convert = TRUE)

# Create hotspot coordinate table, for later use
wifi.corresp <-
    wifi.map %>%
    select(site_id, site_clean, site_geo_x, site_geo_y) %>%
    rename(site = site_clean) %>%
    distinct()
```


```{r}
# Join main dataframe with the clean hotspot mapping
wifi <-
    wifi %>%
    left_join(wifi.map, by = c("site" = "site_key")) %>%
    select(-site) %>%
    rename(site = site_clean)
```

## Analysis

### Most popular hotspots

Let's first look at the most used hotspots, in terms of number of connections and output volume (in Mo).

```{r}
graph_popular <- 
    wifi %>% 
    filter(!is.na(site_id)) %>%
    group_by(site_id, site) %>% 
    summarise(connections = n(), 
              avg_volume = sum(output_mo) / connections) %>% 
    arrange(desc(connections)) %>%
    left_join(wifi.corresp) %>%
    ungroup()

graph_popular %>%
    select(site, connections, avg_volume) %>%
    head(10) %>%
    kable(col.names = c("Site", "Connections", "Average volume (Mo)"),
          digits = 2)
```


The most popular hotspot is the square just behind the Notre-Dame cathedral, which is a very touristic area, so this result does not come as a surprise. 

We can draw the full results on a map.

```{r}
# Define a map style and save it for later
googlemap.style <- "style=element:geometry%7Ccolor:0x242f3e&style=element:labels%7Cvisibility:off&style=feature:administrative.land_parcel%7Cvisibility:off&style=feature:administrative.neighborhood%7Cvisibility:off&style=feature:poi.park%7Celement:geometry%7Ccolor:0x263c3f&style=feature:road%7Celement:geometry%7Ccolor:0x38414e&style=feature:road%7Celement:geometry.stroke%7Ccolor:0x212a37&style=feature:road.highway%7Celement:geometry%7Ccolor:0x746855&style=feature:road.highway%7Celement:geometry.stroke%7Ccolor:0x1f2835&style=feature:transit%7Celement:geometry%7Ccolor:0x2f3948&style=feature:water%7Celement:geometry%7Ccolor:0x17263c"

googlemap.graph <- 
    get_googlemap(center = c(lon = 2.33, lat = 48.86), zoom = 12, 
                  size = c(640, 500), scale = 2, maptype = "roadmap", 
                  style = googlemap.style)
```


```{r}
# Plot hotspots by volume
ggmap(googlemap.graph) + theme_void() +
      geom_point(data = graph_popular, colour = "yellow",
                 aes(x = site_geo_x, y = site_geo_y, size = connections, 
                     alpha = avg_volume))
```

### Top languages
```{r}
# Top 10 languages
wifi %>%
    group_by(language) %>%
    summarise(percent = n() / nrow(wifi) * 100) %>%
    arrange(desc(percent)) %>%
    filter(!is.na(language)) %>%
    top_n(10) %>%
    kable(col.names = c("Language", "Share %"), digits = 1)
```

French represents only less than half of the connections on public wifi, followed by English. 

```{r}
graph_language <-
    wifi %>%
    filter(!is.na(site_id)) %>%
    group_by(site_id, language) %>%
    summarise(connections = n()) %>%
    ungroup() %>%
    group_by(site_id) %>%
    mutate(lang_pct = round(connections / sum(connections), 4),
           total_count = sum(connections)) %>%
    arrange(site_id, desc(connections)) %>%
    filter(!is.na(language)) %>%
    top_n(n = 1, wt = lang_pct) %>%
    left_join(wifi.corresp)
```

```{r}
ggmap(googlemap.graph) + theme_void() +
    geom_point(data = graph_language,
               aes(x = site_geo_x, y = site_geo_y, size = connections,
                   colour = language, alpha = lang_pct))
```

The map above shows the most used language by hotspot. While most are French, a number of mostly touristic areas have more devices set to English. There is also one hotspot where the most frequent language is Arabic.

```{r}
graph_language %>%
    ungroup() %>%
    filter(language != "fr", total_count > 5000) %>%
    arrange(desc(total_count)) %>%
    transmute(site, language, lang_pct * 100, total_count) %>%
    kable(col.names = c("Site", "#1 Language", "Language Share %", "Site Connections"))
```

### Connections per day and hour

```{r}
# Weekday and hour
graph_weekday_hour <-
    wifi %>%
    mutate(weekday = wday(start_time, label = TRUE),
           hour = hour(start_time)) %>%
    group_by(weekday, hour) %>%
    summarise(connections = n())
```

```{r}
ggplot(graph_weekday_hour, aes(hour, weekday, fill = connections)) +
    geom_tile() +
    # coord_polar(theta = "y") +
    scale_fill_distiller(palette = "Blues", direction = 1) 
```

Looking at the number of connections per weekday and hour, we see a classic pattern during daytime. However there is a strange drop of connections on Monday, that we wouldn't expect.

```{r}
# Every day of the year
graph_dayofyear <-
    wifi %>%
    mutate(day = day(start_time),
           month = month(start_time, label = TRUE)) %>%
    group_by(month, day) %>%
    summarise(connections = n())
```

```{r}
ggplot(graph_dayofyear, aes(day, month)) +
    geom_raster(aes(fill = connections)) +
    scale_fill_distiller(palette = "Blues", direction = 1)
```

When we plot the same figures by day of the year 2016, we see that there is a problem in the data: no connections have been recorded on the first 3 days of April through March, while there is are much more connections on 4-12 Janury to March. There is obviously a mixup in the dates, months and days have probably been inverted for 1-3 April to 1-3 December.  

### Mobile vs Computer

On average, 67% of all connections are made on Mobile/Tablet. 
But where do people use mobiles/tablets and computers the most ?

```{r}
graph_device_type <-
    wifi %>%
    filter(!is.na(site_id)) %>%
    # filter(device_type %in% c("Mobile/Tablet", "Computer")) %>%
    group_by(site_id, device_type) %>%
    summarise(connections = n()) %>%
    mutate(mobile_pct = connections / sum(connections)) %>%
    filter(device_type == "Mobile/Tablet") %>%
    left_join(wifi.corresp) %>%
    ungroup()
```


```{r}
graph_device_type %>%
    select(site, connections, mobile_pct) %>%
    mutate(mobile_pct = mobile_pct * 100) %>%
    filter(connections > 5000) %>%
    arrange(desc(mobile_pct)) %>%
    head(10) %>% 
    kable(col.names = c("Site", "Connections", "Mobile share"),
          digits = 1, caption = "Hotspots with high Mobile/Tablet share")
```


```{r}
graph_device_type %>%
    select(site, connections, mobile_pct) %>%
    mutate(mobile_pct = mobile_pct * 100) %>%
    filter(connections > 5000) %>%
    arrange(mobile_pct) %>%
    head(10) %>%
    kable(col.names = c("Site", "Connections", "Mobile share"),
          digits = 1, caption = "Hotspots with high Computer share")
```

Let's recap this on a map, with the color indicating if the hotspot is used more by Mobiles or Computers.

```{r}
ggmap(googlemap.graph) + theme_void() +
      geom_point(data = graph_device_type,
                 aes(x = site_geo_x, y = site_geo_y, size = connections,
                     colour = mobile_pct), alpha = 0.5) +
      scale_colour_distiller(type = "div", palette = 4)
```

### Preferred brands

Note that about 27% of connections do not have a country indication from the device, and that we have identified only 67% of devices brands. However, this still leaves us with 1.1M connections to analyse.

```{r}
graph_device_brands <-
    wifi %>%
    group_by(device_brand, device_type) %>%
    summarise(percent = (n() / nrow(wifi)) * 100) %>%
    arrange(desc(percent)) %>% 
    filter(!is.na(device_brand) & !is.na(device_type))

kable(head(graph_device_brands, 10), digits = 1,
      col.names = c("Brand", "Device Type", "Share %"))
```

Apple is clearly leading the way, with 38% share of devices, both mobile and computers, followed by Samsung. All other brands are below 2%.
