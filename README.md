# Data science portfolio

This is my book of experiments in data science. I am currently working as Business Analyst in a major tech company and my objective is to shift from analyst to plain Data Scientist. Over the last 4 years, I did a lot of self-education, and finally completed a graduate certificate from Stanford in 2016. In this portfolio, I publish some of my work.
