# Data science portfolio

This is my book of experiments in data science. I am a 35-year old French guy, working as Business Analyst in a major tech company.

My objective is to shift from analyst to plain Data Scientist, so I did a lot of self education over the last 3 years, and completed a graduate certificate at Stanford in 2016. I spend a significant part of my free time (when my 2-year old daughter allows it) practicing on data science projects, to sharpen my skills and increase my knowledge. In this portfolio, I publish some of my work.
